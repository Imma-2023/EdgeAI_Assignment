# 📘 Edge AI & IoT Assignment

## Part 1: Theory

### Q1: Edge AI — Latency & Privacy
Edge AI processes data locally on devices, reducing delays and avoiding the need to send information to the cloud.  
This leads to:
- Faster decisions (low latency)  
- Better privacy since data remains on the device

**Example:**  
Autonomous drones use Edge AI to detect obstacles instantly without relying on internet connectivity.

### Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI
- Classical AI uses standard computers and struggles with very large optimization problems.  
- Quantum AI uses quantum principles (superposition, entanglement) to explore many solutions at once and solve optimization problems faster.

**Industries that benefit:**  
Logistics, finance, energy, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing.

## Part 2: Practical Implementation

### Task 1 — Edge AI Prototype (TensorFlow Lite)
- Trained a lightweight CNN model using TensorFlow  
- Converted model to TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)  
- Tested on sample images  
- Demonstrated real-time performance and privacy benefits

### Task 2 — Smart Agriculture IoT Concept
Designed a system using sensors:
- Soil moisture  
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Light  
- pH  
- CO₂  

AI model: Random Forest or LSTM to predict crop yield  
Data flow: Sensors → Edge device → Cloud AI → Farmer dashboard
